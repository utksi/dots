## Dotfiles for arch+KDE+Kwin

This is for OS: arch, DE: KDE, WM: Kwin (Wayland).

At the time of the last commit, the kernel is: ```Linux 6.10.10-arch1-1```.

It should be fine to simply copy everything to ```~/.config```, except for the ```.rc``` files in the top level directory.

Other ```rc``` config files are in ```./dots/rcs/``` and should be copied to ```~/.config/```.
